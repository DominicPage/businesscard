                    I thought it might be nice for my existing, or any potential
                    new customers to get to know me a little better. Maybe
                    you're in two minds to book, or you just curious after
                    already seeing me several times before. Either way I thought
                    this would be a cute little way of providing you all with
                    some extra information about me, my salon and experience...
                    and a few little bonus items!

                  </header>
                  <p>
                    Lithuania is renown for its beauty industry and the
                    education and standard there sits near the very top of what
                    Europe has to offer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My beauty education strted at school and university and it
                    wasn't long before my artistic styles got me recognised. I
                    was working for one of the top Salon's in Vilnius (the
                    capital city of Lithuania) where i learned from some truly
                    amazing people. After moving to Guernsey I kept up my skills
                    by working on my friends nails for free, but as word of
                    mouth spread and I started hearing about the feedback on the
                    work I was doing I decided to look for opportunities to get
                    back into the industry.

                    <h3>My Journey to this point</h3>
                  </header>
                  <p>
                    Originally from Lithuania, I moved to London in June 2009,
                    this being my first real attempt at life out of my own
                    country, not speaking a word of the local language it was a
                    massive culture shock. However, even with the initial
                    language barrier it did not take me long to realise that I
                    was not a city girl. Looking at what options may have been
                    available to me I was told about this little gem in the
                    English Channel named Guernsey! A quick conversation with a
                    friend who lived there convinced me to immediately pack my
                    things and continue my journey onwards to what was almost a
                    completely unknown destination.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It did not take me long to realise one of the first
                    drawbacks to living on Guernsey... Trying to explain to
                    people where it actually is! It took a very long and
                    detailed conversation with my parents to narrow it down to
                    this tiny rock off the coast of France. There initial
                    question of "But... why?!" did seem to make quite a lot of
                    sense at the time, and when it was asked I did not initially
                    have an anwer for them, but it didn't take me long to
                    discover the natural beauty of the island and after a few
                    images of the cobo sunset were sent home I think my family
                    quickly realised the answer!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I spent most of my time here just getting used to the
                    language. Still being a relatively new English speaker it
                    was a big challenge for me to adapt to working life
                    especially and it took me about 7 years of living on the
                    island to get enough confidence to get back into beauty.
                    Always practicing on with my friends coming up with new
                    design I was always a very artistic person and this work was
                    a real passion for me so I was so happy to get back into it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It didn't take me long to realise that people were really
                    appreciating the work I was doing. I decided to get my head
                    down, work hard at build up enough money to move into my own
                    place. The journey for me has been amazing, thinking where I
                    was less than 10 years ago to where I am now. Hopefully this
                    is just the start of a new beginning with plenty more of the
                    journey left to go...
